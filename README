Greasemonkey scripts for Hattrick are developed here.
I wan't to add some game functionality and improve game experience.

So far script can
  - Display team players avatars even if you don't support the game developers, (N)
  - hide annoying ads on page. (S)

Legend:
 (N) - useful for nonsupporters (this functionality is already a part of game if you are supporter),
 (S) - useful for supporters and nonsupporters
